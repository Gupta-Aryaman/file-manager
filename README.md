    ```

7. **Setting up the PostgreSQL Database** - 
    - Open pgAdmin -> create a server -> create database and put the database name **file_manager**
    - Right click the database **file_manager** and click on "Query Tool"

        file_owner uuid NOT NULL,
        FOREIGN KEY (file_owner) REFERENCES users(user_id)
